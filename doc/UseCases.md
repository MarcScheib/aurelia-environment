# Use Cases

The **aurelia-environment** plugin is ideally suited for decoupling configuration properties of your application from the source code. For example, during the development phase, you are using development logging printing a lot of information. By relying on Continuous Integration and Delivery, the application is built automatically with each release commit to the VCS. The source code is bundled and configuration is included as is, most of the time with development configuration.

**aurelia-environment** allows to specify the configuration in an extra file. It is easily exchangeable depending on the deployment environment. It is even possible to simply generate it via cli.

The following sections list some example use cases on where to use the plugin
